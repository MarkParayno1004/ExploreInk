          For the past few years, we have been facing a hard time that we must focus on our health.
          We all focus on being physically healthy so sometimes we forget to look for our mental health.
          Fitness is important to improve your physical and mental health, and these two must not separate.
        </p>
      </br>
        <strong>What is Fitness?</strong>
      </br>
          Fitness means being physically fit and healthy.
          Fitness is defined as being able to perform daily activities that you don’t easily feel tired of,
          and fulfilling the different components from your cardiovascular, flexibility, strength and endurance, and body composition.
        </br>
      </br>
          <strong>How Fitness Important to Physical and Mental Health?</strong>
        </br>
        Our body and mind are connected to each other. Having good physical health can reduce the risk of developing different diseases and decrease the risk of developing mental health problems. Similarly,
        a positive mind can affect your physical health and reduce the risk of having a heart problem.
      </br>
        By maintaining a fit body and mind can prevent different physical and mental health problems. These two aspects are intertwined: a poor mind is a poor body. On the other hand, a healthy mind is having a strong body.
      </br>
    </br>
        <strong>How to be Physically and Mentally Fit?</strong>
      </br>
      So how can we achieve that? Have some recreational activities such as jogging, walking, bicycling, hiking, yoga, etc.
      Do exercises at least 15-30 minutes a day. Make a routine on how you will have a good lifestyle to maintain physically fit.
    </br>
      Eat healthy foods that are rich in vitamins, protein, calcium and more. Have some rest, sleep at least 7 to 9 hours, have a healthy social life, make some meditations and anything you want to be relaxed and stress-free.
