    Cooking is definitely a fun activity with your family.
    But don’t you know that there are proper hygiene and practices that we must do when we cook.
  </br>
</br>
  <strong>Here are the ten common mistakes and unsanitary manner that you shouldn’t do when you cook.</strong>
</br>
  </br>
</br>
   <ol>
     <li>
       <strong>TASTING FOODS USING FINGERS OR THE COOKING UTENSILS</strong>
     </br>
     This is an unsanitary manner, don’t use your fingers to taste or the ladle you use for cooking and dip it back into the food.
     Use a spoon when you have to taste the food.
     </li>
   </br>
  </br>
      <li>
        <strong>UNTIED HAIR OR WITHOUT WEARING A HAIRNET</strong>
      </br>
      When we watch cooking shows or vloggers, some of them are that the hair is just loose like their hair will get into the food.
      Before you cook, you must tie your hair or wear a hairnet (practical practice), or anything that will keep your hair from falling into the food.
      </li>
    </br>
   </br>
       <li>
         <strong>LONG FINGERNAILS AND ACRYLIC NAILS</strong>
       </br>
       Having a clean hands with a neat short fingernails are better because it prevents to harbor dirt and bacteria and will be mix to the food.
       Acrylics nails should not be worn while handling foods since they can break off to the food.
       </li>
     </br>
    </br>
        <li>
          <strong>NO FACEMASK OR TALKING WHILE COOKING</strong>
        </br>
        Don’t talk if you don’t wear a facemask in front of food, because your saliva will fall off to the food. I'm sure you don’t want to taste another flavor.
        </li>
      </br>
     </br>
         <li>
           <strong> WEARING BRACELETS AND OTHER ACCESSORIES</strong>
         </br>
         Wearing bracelets, wristwatches or any accessories is not practical while cooking.
         It can disturb you because it keeps falling off and may dip into the food, or may dip on the non-stick pan which is not good for metallic things.
         </li>
       </br>
      </br>
          <li>
            <strong> NO APRON</strong>
          </br>
          Everyone when cooking at home doesn't use an apron, I understand because I do too.
          However, it is sanitary to keep our clothes clean from any stains and best if you have a hand towel to use to keep you clean.
          </li>
        </br>
       </br>
           <li>
             <strong> IMPROPER WAY OF CUTTING</strong>
           </br>
           There are proper ways of cutting vegetables, fruits and meat, that surely would not cut your finger too.
           Make sure your knife is sharp, hold the food using your palm and the tips of your finger with your fingers pointing down into the food and your end knuckles slightly bent to protect your fingers from the blade.
           </li>
         </br>
        </br>
            <li>
              <strong> SAME CUTTING BOARD AND KNIFE</strong>
            </br>
            Another unsanitary manner when you used the same cutting board and knife for all foods.
            Chicken meat should have a separate cutting board to prevent cross-contamination, similarly with other meat, and vegetables and fruits.
            </li>
          </br>
         </br>
             <li>
               <strong> UNWASHED HANDS AFTER CRACKING THE EGG</strong>
             </br>
             After you crack the egg, you should immediately wash your hands before touching anything especially the foods to prevent spread of Salmonella.
             </li>
           </br>
          </br>
              <li>
                <strong>  IMPROPER WAY TO STORE MEAT</strong>
              </br>
              There are proper ways to store meat in your refrigerator. Store raw meat and poultry in clean, sealed containers on the bottom shelf of the fridge,
              so they can't touch or drip onto other food and keep separated in cooked meat.
              When you already thaw the meat, it's not practical to refreeze it again because it will reduce the meat quality and will develop a harmful bacteria.
	            Have you discovered something new and feel guilty with the above mentions? All you must remember while cooking is cleanliness to prevent cross-contamination.

               <li>
                 <strong> WEARING BRACELETS AND OTHER ACCESSORIES</strong>
               </br>
               Wearing bracelets, wristwatches or any accessories is not practical while cooking.
               It can disturb you because it keeps falling off and may dip into the food, or may dip on the non-stick pan which is not good for metallic things.
