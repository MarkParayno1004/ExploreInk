  This is an interesting question; however, Schooling will find you a line of work, which will bring you cash. Cash presents to you the necessities of life: water, food, and shelter. I imagine that learning is a higher priority than cash. At the point when we are young, we do not need to stress over cash, however we stress about schooling and learning, because our folks purchase everything for us. Then, as we get more older, if we have fundamental learning or knowledge (essential information) we can find a well-paying line of work and bring in cash to help our family, take care of bills/obligations and so forth Along these lines, schooling is better/more significant than cash. It explains having more knowledge can secure a better future for you. For my opinion, it is much better to have more experience and knowledge because while you are growing old money is becoming lesser and the only thing that will remain to you is knowledge and experience. These two will make you wiser and can help you in life.
